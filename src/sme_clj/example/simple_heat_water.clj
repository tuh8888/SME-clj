  "Example adapted from SME literature [1], of an analogy between the flow of
  water from a large beaker through a pipe to a small vial, and the flow of
  heat from a cup of coffee through a bar into an ice cube.

  This is the running example Falkenhainer et al. use in their description of
  the SME algorithm.
